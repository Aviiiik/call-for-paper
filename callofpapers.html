            We are committed to prompt evaluation and Presentation / Publication of fully accepted papers in <u>International Conference on Emerging Areas in Computational Science and Allied Fields (IEACA 2022)</u>. To maintain a high-quality publication, all submissions undergo a rigorous review process. <br><br>
            
            Characteristics of the blind peer review process are as follows:<br>
            
            <ul type="disc" style="text-align:justify">
            <li type="disc">Simultaneous submissions of the same Research Article / Manuscript to different Conference / Journals / Symposium will not be accepted.<br><br>
            
                <li type="disc">Manuscripts with contents outside the scope will not be considered for review.<br><br>

            <h2 class="ser-title">ETHICAL POLICY FOR IEACA 2022</h2>
<hr class="botm-line" align="left">
<p style="text-align:justify">
The ethical policy of International Conference on Emerging Areas in Computational Science and Allied Fields
(IEACA 2022) follows the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity<br>
lin(http://www.allea.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ALLEA-European-Code-of-Conduct-for-Research-Integrity-2017.pdf).
<br> <br>
Authors must be honest in presenting their results and conclusions of their research. Research misconduct is harmful for knowledge. It could mislead other researchers.
<br><br>

	<b>(a)	Research results</b><br><br>
	
Fabrication, falsification or selective reporting of data with the intent to mislead or deceive is unethical, as is the theft of data or research results from others. The results of research should be recorded and maintained to allow for analysis and review. Following publication, the data should be retained for a reasonable period and made available upon request. Exceptions may be appropriate in certain circumstances in order to preserve privacy, to assure patent protection, or for similar reasons.<br><br>
	
	<b>(b)	Authorship</b><br><br>
	
All those who have made a significant contribution should be given chance to be cited as authors. Other individuals who have contributed to the work should be acknowledged. Articles should include a full list of the current institutional affiliations of all authors, both academic and corporate. <br><br>

	<b>(c)	Plagiarism</b><br><br>
	
Reproducing text from other papers without properly crediting the source (plagiarism) or producing many papers with almost the same content by the same authors (self-plagiarism) is not acceptable. Submitting the same results to more than one journal concurrently is unethical. Exceptions are the review articles. Authors may not present results obtained by others as if they were their own. Authors should acknowledge the work of others used in their research and cite publications that have influenced the direction and course of their study. </br><br>
	
	<b>(d)	Duplicate submission</b><br><br>
	
Simultaneous submissions of the same Research Article / Manuscript to different Conference(s) / journal(s) will not be tolerated. The submitted article will be removed without consideration â€“ if found that the submitted article found duplicate anywhere else.<br><br>

	<b>(e)	Human and Animal Rights</b><br><br>
	
If the work involves the use of human subjects or human medical data, then author should ensure that the work described has been carried out in accordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans;<br><br>

Clinical Trial Results,  Reporting Clinical Trials, Registration of Clinical Trials â€“ must follow The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association.<br>
